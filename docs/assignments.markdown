|Assignment 1:|
|-------------|
|In this assignment, we were working with a dataset we took as a class of the elevator arrival times on the ground floor in CDS. Using this dataset, I took an educated guess on where to stand, then computed for the total time we observed the elevators, number of arrivals, frequency, and probability for each elevator. Using this information I then calculated for the weighted centroid which gave me the best location to wait in order to minimize the expected walking distance to the next arriving elevator. Then using that location I calculated the average distance traveled to the next elevator arrival over the training dataset and the testing dataset.|

|Assignment 3:|
|-------------|
|In this assignment, I implemented Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the MNIST database, in order to learn about the balance between accuracy and computational complexity. Though writing my own code to implement SVD and dimensionality reduction in Python, I was able to visualize the results and make informed decision about the number of dimensions, and how they relate to the performance of a classifier.

|Assignment 5:|
|-------------|
|In this assignment, I implemented  implement a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to predict customer churn for a bank. It identifies customers who are likely to leave the bank based on historical data.|

|Midterm:|
|-------------|
|In this Midterm I competed in a [kaggle compition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cs-506-midterm-fall-2024/overview) that predicts the star rating associated with user reviews from Amazon Movie Reviews using the available features.|

|Assignment 6:|
|-------------|
|In this assignment, I built a interactive webpage that lets users adjust the sample size, mean of noise, variance of noise, and the number of simulations, in order to observe how these changes affect the slope and intercept of a linear regression model.|

|Assignment 7:|
|-------------|
|In this assignment, I extended on my previous work from Assignment 6 to include hypothesis testing and confidence intervals through simulations. I enhanced the interactive webpage to allow users to perform hypothesis tests on the slope or intercept of the regression line and generate confidence intervals based on simulations.|

|In this assignment, I explored the effect of shifting clusters in a dataset on the parameters of a logistic regression model.|

|Assignment 9:|
|-------------|
|In this assignment, I implemented and analyzed a simple neural network by visualizing its learned features, decision boundary, and gradients.|
